Improved Vanilla hud - Customization instructions
By errur
=======================================================
In this folder there are a few options. To enable an option open the folder of your choice and copy all the inside files (except screenshots) into the IVhud_ folder. Overwrite everything. 

IMPORTANT: All the .res files will be in hud/resource/ui unless stated otherwise.

- Mini health and ammo displays appear in the middle of the screen when critical on ammo or health. There's an option to remove them compleately.

- To get rid of the heart health copy over the files from the health cross folder.

- To change the damage text font copy over the files from the alternative damage numbers folder or open up resource/ui/huddamageaccount.res with a text editor.
  Find the first entry ("CDamageAccountPanel") and edit "delta_item_font" for normal damage text and "delta_item_font_big" for critical damage text.
  Some valid fonts are: HudFontSmall, HudFontMedium, HudFontMediumSmall, HudFontMediumBig. Add Bold after the font name to make it use the TF2 Build bold font (ex: HudFontSmallBold).
  If you wanna change the last damage done (the numbers near the health) color, go to DamageAccountValue (still in huddamageaccount.res) and edit the value of fgcolor.

- To revert to default damage text and remove it from above your health remove huddamageaccount.res.

- To swap the hat and weapon panels on the loadout screen go to classloadoutpanel.res and find "item_xpos_offcenter_a" and "item_xpos_offcenter_b", swap the values. Restart the game for it to take effect.

- To revert to the default loadout screen remove classloadoutpanel.res

- To revert to old loadout screen rotation only mode open resource/ui/classloadoutpanel.res and change "allow_manip" to "allow_rot"

About transparent viewmodel and crosshair :

Transparent viewmodel can be enabled in hud/scripts/hudlayout_transparent_viewmodel.res, just change the value of visible and enabled to 1, restart the game if needed.

Many crosshair are included in the hud, to activate them navigate to hud/resource/crosshairs then open crosshair.res and follow the instructions inside. Crosshair animation is also available in hud/resource/crosshairs/crosshair_animation.txt
